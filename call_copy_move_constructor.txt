In C++, you can call the copy constructor and move constructor explicitly or implicitly.

Explicitly calling the copy constructor:

scss
Copy code
MyClass<T> obj1(10);
MyClass<T> obj2(obj1);
Explicitly calling the move constructor:

scss
Copy code
MyClass<T> obj1(10);
MyClass<T> obj2(std::move(obj1));
Implicit calls to the copy constructor occur when:

An object is passed by value to a function.
An object is returned by value from a function.
An object is initialized with another object of the same type.
Implicit calls to the move constructor occur when:

An object is passed or returned by value with std::move.
Note: The move constructor is only called if the class has a move constructor defined, otherwise the copy constructor will be used.
