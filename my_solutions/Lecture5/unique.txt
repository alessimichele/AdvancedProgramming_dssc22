The difference between data.reset(new T[N]) and data = std::make_unique<T[]>(N) in C++ is that:

data.reset(new T[N]) resets the std::unique_ptr data to point to a newly dynamically allocated array of N elements of type T. reset is a member function of std::unique_ptr that can change the object the unique_ptr is managing. The dynamically allocated memory is owned by the unique_ptr and will be automatically deallocated when data goes out of scope or is reset again.

data = std::make_unique<T[]>(N) does the same as data.reset(new T[N]), but uses the std::make_unique function. This is a helper function that was introduced in C++14 to create a unique_ptr and initialize it with a dynamically allocated object in a single line. This can make code more readable and reduce the possibility of errors when allocating memory.

Both data.reset(new T[N]) and data = std::make_unique<T[]>(N) are equivalent and create a unique_ptr that manages a dynamically allocated array of N elements of type T.
