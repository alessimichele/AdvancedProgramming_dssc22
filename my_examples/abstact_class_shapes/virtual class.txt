how to recognize a virtual class
In C++, a class can be made virtual by using the virtual keyword in the class declaration. This is typically done when you want to create a base class that is meant to be used as a interface, but not as an actual concrete class. The main difference between a virtual class and a regular class is that a virtual class can contain pure virtual functions, which means that it has at least one function that does not have an implementation and must be overridden by any derived class that inherits from the virtual class.

Here's an example of a virtual class in C++:

c++
Copy code
class VirtualClass {
public:
    virtual void someFunction() = 0;  // pure virtual function
    virtual void anotherFunction() {
        cout << "This is a virtual function with an implementation." << endl;
    }
};
In this example, the VirtualClass class is declared as virtual because it contains a pure virtual function, someFunction(). This function has no implementation in the base class and must be overridden by any derived class that inherits from VirtualClass. The anotherFunction() function is also declared as virtual, but it has an implementation in the base class. This means that it can be overridden by any derived class, but it doesn't have to be.

To recognize a virtual class in C++, you can look for the virtual keyword in the class declaration, as well as any pure virtual functions that are declared in the class. If a class contains at least one pure virtual function, it is considered an abstract class and cannot be instantiated directly. Any class that derives from the virtual class must implement all pure virtual functions or else they will also be considered abstract classes.

you have used virtual class as synonym of abstract class?
Yes, I used "virtual class" as a synonym for "abstract class" in my previous response. In C++, the terms "virtual class" and "abstract class" are often used interchangeably to refer to a class that is designed to be used as a base class and cannot be instantiated directly.

In general, an abstract class is a class that has at least one pure virtual function, which means it has no implementation and must be overridden by any derived class that inherits from it. The purpose of an abstract class is to provide a common interface for a group of related classes.

The term "virtual" is often used in the context of C++ because the virtual keyword is used to declare virtual functions and virtual inheritance, which are key features of polymorphism in C++. But in the context of abstract classes, "virtual" is often used interchangeably with "abstract" to describe the same concept.

what is a virtual function
A virtual function is a member function in a C++ class that is declared with the virtual keyword and is intended to be overridden by derived classes.

When a virtual function is called on an object of a derived class, the version of the function that is executed is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object. This is known as dynamic dispatch or late binding, and it is a key feature of polymorphism in C++.

Here is an example of a virtual function in C++:

c++
Copy code
class Base {
public:
    virtual void someFunction() {
        cout << "This is a virtual function in the base class." << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void someFunction() override {
        cout << "This is the overridden version of the virtual function in the derived class." << endl;
    }
};
In this example, the someFunction() function in the Base class is declared as virtual. When a derived class, such as Derived, inherits from Base and overrides the someFunction() function, it can use the override keyword to indicate that it is intended to override the virtual function in the base class.

When you call the someFunction() function on an object of the Derived class, the version of the function that is executed is the one that is defined in the Derived class, rather than the one in the Base class. This is because the function is declared as virtual, which means that the version of the function that is executed is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object.

difference between virtual function and pure virtual function is that pure ones must be overridden by each child class, while virtual function doesn't have to?
Yes, that's correct. The main difference between a virtual function and a pure virtual function in C++ is that a pure virtual function must be overridden by any concrete class that derives from the abstract base class, while a virtual function does not have to be overridden.

A pure virtual function is a virtual function that is declared with the = 0 syntax in the base class. It has no implementation in the base class, and any class that inherits from the base class must provide an implementation for the pure virtual function, or else it too will be an abstract class.

Here's an example of a pure virtual function:

c++
Copy code
class Shape {
public:
    virtual double area() const = 0; // pure virtual function
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    Circle(double radius) : radius(radius) {}
    double area() const override {
        return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
    }
private:
    double radius;
};
In this example, Shape is an abstract base class because it has a pure virtual function area(), which has no implementation. Any concrete class that inherits from Shape, such as Circle, must override the area() function and provide an implementation. If a derived class fails to do so, it will also be an abstract class.

In contrast, a virtual function in a base class has a default implementation that can be overridden by any derived class that chooses to do so. If a derived class does not override the virtual function, the default implementation in the base class will be used.

Here's an example of a virtual function:

c++
Copy code
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() {
        cout << "Animal sound" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        cout << "Woof!" << endl;
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
    // no makeSound() function defined in Cat
};
In this example, the Animal class has a virtual function makeSound(), which has a default implementation that prints "Animal sound". The Dog class overrides the virtual function and provides its own implementation, which prints "Woof!". The Cat class does not define a makeSound() function, so it uses the default implementation from the Animal class.
