The Rule of 0-3-5 is a guideline in C++ that outlines the responsibilities of a class regarding resource management. The rule states that a class should:

The idea behind the Rule of 0-3-5 is to minimize the amount of manual resource management required in a class and to ensure that classes are easy to use and maintain. In general, if a class does not manage any dynamically allocated resources, it
